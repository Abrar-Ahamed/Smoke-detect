# Estimating-Presence-or-Absence-of-Smoking-Through-Bio-Signals-Dataset

The estimation of smoking behavior is of significant interest in various fields, including healthcare, public health, and behavior analysis. 
Traditional methods for assessing smoking status rely on self-reporting, which can be prone to bias and inaccuracies. 
However, advancements in technology and the availability of bio-signal datasets have opened up new possibilities for estimating smoking behavior objectively. 
This project aims to provide an overview of using bio-signals to estimate the presence or absence of smoking, offering insights into the methods and techniques employed in this field. 

# Project Structure description
### The "smoke-detectection-biosignals" directory contains the files required to run the application.
### smoke_detection.py file is the python notebook for model creation.
### The saved model "final_model_1.pkl" is given as drive link in the "smoke-detection-biosignals" directory. 
### The report and demo video is available in the main directory itself.
